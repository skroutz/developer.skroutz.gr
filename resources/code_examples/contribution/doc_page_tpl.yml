  # [H1] Page Title <%= render_edit_link %>

  It would be nice to write a short description of the current page.


  <%= partial 'partials/toc' %>


  ## [H2] Page Section

  This is a very cool component that you can use to create an awesome application
  or even make a fine cup of delicious espresso.

  > ##### Note
  > Always use filtered water to make espresso. Using water with high mineral
    content can result in off-tasting espresso and mineral buildup.

  ### [H3] Sub section

  Espresso beans for the <%= settings.site_name.capitalize %> can be found in
  many places. Here is a list of available places with a short description:

  Place 1
  : This is a cool place.

  Place 2
  : This is a cool place too.

  Place 3
  : Ok, you got the point.

  #### [H4] Sub section paragraph

  The following code snippet shows how you can grind the espresso beans:

  ~~~ coffeescript
  # Create a new instance of CoffeeGrinder
  espresso_grinder = new CoffeeGrinder()

  # Set the coffee type and grind level
  grinder.coffee_type = 'espresso'
  grinder.level = 'finest'

  # Grind it
  grinder.start()
  ~~~
