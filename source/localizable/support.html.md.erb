## FAQ

### General

I found a typo in the documentation. What do I do?
: This website is a [public GitHub repository](<%= settings.github_profile %>/developer.skroutz.gr).
  Fix it and submit a pull request.

### API

How do I obtain OAuth credentials?
: [Fill out our request form](<%= settings.api_access_form %>).

How do I access X resource?
: Read our <%= link_to 'API documentation', '/api/v3' %> thoroughly.
: If you can't find what you want it may be due to missing documentation or it may
  be something we've decided not to expose yet.

Why did I get less results than what I expected from my request?
: Most resources support [pagination](/api/v3/#pagination). If you are making
  requests and are receiving an incomplete set of results, you 're probably
  seeing only the first page. You'll need to ask for the remaining pages with
  subsequent requests in order to get more results.
