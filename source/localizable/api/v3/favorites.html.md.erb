## Types of Favorite Lists

User may pick one or more SKUs as favorites. Favorites are organized in `favorite_lists`.

3 *types* of `favorite_lists` exist:

Custom lists
: Can contain SKUs from different categories. These are created by the user.

Auto lists
: These are connected with a category and can only contain favorite SKUs
from this category. These are created automatically when a new favorite is
created without specifying a <code>favorite_list</code>.

&quot;Owned&quot; list
: This is a special list that includes favorites that the user has
flagged as &quot;owned&quot;. Items in the list have `favorite_list_id: null`
and `have_it: true` attributes. This way owned favorites can be presented as a list.

## List favorite lists

<pre class="terminal">
  GET /favorite_lists
</pre>

<%= render_recording :favorite_lists_index %>

## Create a favorite_list

It trying to create a custom list with the same name as an existing custom
list you will be presented with an error message.

<pre class="terminal">
  POST /favorite_lists?favorite_list[name]=a+new+list+name
</pre>

<%= render_recording :favorite_list_create %>

## Destroy a favorite_list

The response status is 204 and with an empty response body when resource is
destroyed. Status code is 404 when the resource does not exist.

<pre class="terminal">
  DELETE /favorite_lists/:id
</pre>

## List favorites

The parameter `owned` can be set to `true` to fetch only owned favorites.
By default favorites are sorted by creation date descending. `order_dir=asc` can
be used to fetch them with ascending order.

<pre class="terminal">

</pre>

</pre>

<%= render_recording :favorites_show %>

</pre>

<%= render_recording :favorite_create %>

## Destroy a favorite

<pre class="terminal">
  DELETE /favorites/:id
</pre>

## Update a favorite

A favorite update might be called to do one of the following:

* Move the favorite to an other list (custom probably)
* Mark favorite as &quot;owned&quot; (through have_it: true)
* Add the favorite to a new custom list

When a favorite is `have_it: true`, it does not belong to a *favorite_list*.

If you put a *favorite_list_id* and `have_it: true`, then only *have_it* will be
respected (*favorite_list_id* will be ignored).

You may choose to create a new custom list when creating or updating a favorite,
by specifying the parameter `new_list_name`. A new custom list will be created
(if it does not exist) with the given name and the favorite will be assigned
to it, `have_it` attribute will be set to `null`.
In case of an error, status 400 will be returned with errors in response body.

<pre class="terminal">
  PUT /favorites/:id?have_it=true
</pre>

<%= render_recording :favorite_update %>
