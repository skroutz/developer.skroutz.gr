## Authorization
To access any API v3 resource an access_token is necessary. Get one using <%= link_to 'OAuth 2.0 Authorization', '/authorization' %>.

## Schema

All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from the `<%= settings.api_domain %>`
domain. All data is sent and received as JSON.

A list of all the example requests in this documentation as a [Postman](http://www.getpostman.com/) 
collection can be found <%= link_to 'here', "/assets/misc/#{flavor}_postman_collection.json" %>.

<pre class="terminal">
curl -XGET http://<%= settings.api_domain %>/categories/999999999 \
  -H 'Accept: application/vnd.<%= settings.site_name %>+json; version=3' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer your_access_token_here'

## Linked Resources

When you see <mark>Linked resources: some_resource</mark> in any of our resources
it means you may choose to include/embed it as follows:

##### Example

Resource Foo has "Linked resources: bar"

###### Case: embed

<pre class="terminal">
  <code>GET /foos/42?embed=bars</code>
</pre>

<%= render_code '{
  "foo": {
    "id": 42,
    "bars": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "baz": 42
      }
    ]
  }
}', 'javascript' %>

###### Case: embed_ids

<pre class="terminal">
  <code>GET /foos/42?embed_ids=bars</code>
</pre>

<%= render_code '{
  "foo": {
    "id": 42,
    "bars": [1,2,3,4]
  }
}', 'javascript' %>


###### Case: include

<pre class="terminal">
  <code>GET /foos?include=bars</code>
</pre>

<%= render_code '{
  "foos": [
    {
      "id": 42,
      "bars": [1,4]
    },
    {
      "id": 43,
      "bars": [3,4]
    }
  ],
  "bars": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "baz": 42
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "baz": 42
    }
  ]
}', 'javascript' %>

## Pagination

Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 25 items by
default.  You can specify further pages with the `page` parameter. You can also 
set a custom page size to 10 with the `per` parameter.

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl https://<%= settings.api_domain %>/categories?page=2&per=10 \
  -H 'Accept: application/vnd.<%= settings.site_name %>+json; version=3' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer your_access_token_here'
</pre>

When there are other pages the response will contain the [Link](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988) header.

~~~
Link

<https://<%= settings.api_domain %>/categories?page=508&per=4>; rel="last",
<https://<%= settings.api_domain %>/categories?page=3&per=4>; rel="next"
~~~

Note that page numbering is 1-based and that ommiting the `page`
parameter will return the first page.

## Rate Limiting

You can make up to a certain amount of requests for each OAuth token associated with your application.

You can check the returned HTTP headers of any API request to see your current
rate limit status:

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -i https://<%= settings.api_domain %>/categories/1440 \
  -H 'Accept: application/vnd.<%= settings.site_name %>+json; version=3' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer your_access_token_here'

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 01 Jul 2013 17:27:06 GMT
Status: 200 OK
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 56
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1372700873
</pre>

The headers tell you everything you need to know about your current rate limit status:

`X-RateLimit-Limit`
: The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make per hour.

`X-RateLimit-Remaining`
: The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window.

`X-RateLimit-Reset`
: The time at which the current rate limit window resets in [UTC epoch seconds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).

If you need the time in a different format, any modern programming language can get the job done. For example, if you open up the console on your web browser, you can easily get the reset time as a JavaScript Date object.

~~~ javascript
new Date(1372700873 * 1000)
// => Mon Jul 01 2013 13:47:53 GMT-0400 (EDT)
~~~

Once you go over the rate limit you will receive an error response:

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -i https://<%= settings.api_domain %>/categories/1440 \
  -H 'Accept: application/vnd.<%= settings.site_name %>+json; version=3' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer your_access_token_here'

HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Date: Tue, 20 Aug 2013 14:50:41 GMT
Status: 403 Forbidden
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1377013266

{
  "message": "API rate limit exceeded. See http://developer.<%= settings.domain %>/api/v3/#rate-limiting for details."
}
</pre>


### Staying within the rate limit

If you are exceeding your rate limit, you can likely fix the issue by caching API responses
and using [conditional requests](#conditional-requests).

If you're using conditional requests and still exceeding your rate
limit, please <%= link_to 'contact us', '/support' %> to request a higher rate limit for your application.

## Conditional Requests

Most responses return `Last-Modified` and `ETag` headers. You can use the values
of these headers to make subsequent requests to those resources using the
`If-Modified-Since` and `If-None-Match` headers, respectively. If the resource
has not changed, the server will return a `304 Not Modified`.

> ##### Note
> Making a conditional request and receiving a `304` HTTP response **does not count** against your
  [Rate Limit](#rate-limiting).

###### Case: Request without `If-Modified-Since` nor `If-None-Match` headers

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -i https://<%= settings.api_domain %>/categories/1440 \
  -H 'Accept: application/vnd.<%= settings.site_name %>+json; version=3' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer your_access_token_here'

X-RateLimit-Limit: 5000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 4996
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1372700873
</pre>

###### Case: Request with `If-Modified-Since` header

<pre class="terminal">
$ curl -i https://<%= settings.api_domain %>/categories/1440  \
  -H "If-Modified-Since: Thu, 05 Jul 2012 15:31:30 GMT" \
  -H 'Accept: application/vnd.<%= settings.site_name %>+json; version=3' \

<pre class="terminal">

  -H 'If-None-Match: "644b5b0155e6404a9cc4bd9d8b1ae730"' \
  -H 'Accept: application/vnd.<%= settings.site_name %>+json; version=3' \

## HTTP Redirects

API v3 uses HTTP redirection where appropriate. Clients should assume that any
request may result in a redirection. Receiving an HTTP redirection is **not an
error** and clients should follow that redirect. Redirect responses will have a
`Location` header field which contains the URI of the resource to which the
client should repeat the request.

301
: Permanent redirection. The URI you used to make the request has been
superseded by the one specified in the `Location` header field. This and all
future requests to this resource should be directed to the new URI.

302, 307
: Temporary redirection. The request should be repeated verbatim to the URI
specified in the `Location` header field but clients should continue to use the
original URI for future requests.

Other redirection status codes may be used in accordance with the
[HTTP 1.1 spec](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3).
