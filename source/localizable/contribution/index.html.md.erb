# How To Contribute

Writing proper documentation is hard. We need documentation that is
legible, precise, unambiguous and easy to understand.

This section serves to provide basic instructions on how to organize your
documentation as well as some style guidelines to keep the documentation style
and language consistent across all projects.

> ##### Note
> Since this is a public repository hosted on
  [GitHub](<%= "#{settings.github_profile}/#{settings.developer_domain}" %>)
  please **be careful** what parts of <%= settings.site_name.capitalize %>
  Documentation you are exposing in the wild.

## Getting Started

The project is built with [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) and
documentation is written in [MarkDown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
So, before you start, please make sure to complete these steps:

[Set up](#project-set-up) the project
: Quick guide to have the project up and running locally.

Familiarize with the [project structure](#project-structure)
: Though not mandatory to contribute documentation, it is highly recommended to
  have a quick look on how directories and files are organized.

Learn the [basics of MarkDown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics)
: The [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/) lib is used by default, but
  there are no major differences from *standard* or other MarkDown flavors, e.g.
  [GitHub Flavored MarkDown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown).

Familiarize with the [code style](/contribution/style/)
: Check out how you can enrich your documentation and the rules,
  conventions and guidelines your contribution has to follow to be accepted.

Once, you have completed the above you may proceed to:

[Add documentation](/contribution/new/)
: Follow the guide to add your documentation pages.

[Submit](<%= settings.github_profile %>/developer.skroutz.gr/pulls) your documentation
: Create a [new pull request](<%= settings.github_profile %>/developer.skroutz.gr/pulls).

## Project Set Up

First, clone the project:

<pre class="terminal">
git clone git@github.com:skroutz/developer.skroutz.gr.git
</pre>

Then, install the requirements:

<pre class="terminal">
bundle install
</pre>

Finally, start serving the website locally:

<pre class="terminal">
FLAVOR=<%= settings.site_name %> bundle exec middleman server
</pre>

You may now point your browser at [http://127.0.0.1:4567](http://127.0.0.1:4567)
and view the website.

## Project Structure

The project file structure is based on Middleman's skeleton with minor
additions for the project's needs.

The following paragraphs describe files and directories you should be familiar
with.

### `config.rb`

This is the core configuration file of the project. Consult the
[Middleman documentation](http://middlemanapp.com/basics/getting-started/) for
the available settings and options you can configure here.

### `data/`

It contains setting files for each flavor as well as common settings across
flavors.

`data/docs.yml`
: The `data/docs.yml` file holds the core settings for documentation pages and
  it is used to generate the navigation structure of available documentations,
  featured documentations, etc.

### `lib/`

It contains the custom helpers built for the project along with task files.

### `locales/`

It contains the localization files.

### `resources/`

It contains collections of resource files (e.g. code example snippets, API
responses, etc.) needed by specific documentation pages.

#### `resources/code_examples/`

Contains large code snippets that would be difficult to maintain if placed
inline the documentation. Code examples for a document should be placed within a
directory with the same name that the documentation lives in.
Also, you can have flavored example code snippets if necessary.

See also [Add Documentation](/guidelines/style/#code-examples).

#### `resources/responses/`

Contains the recorded API responses for each flavor.

### `source/`

This is where all the magic exists. In the `source/` directory lives the content
of the project. It contains the static pages, the documentation pages and the
assets of the project.

`source/assets/`
: Contains *JavaScript*, *CSS*, *images*, *fonts* and *miscellaneous* asset files.

`source/localizable/`
: Each document lives in its own directory within `source/localizable/` directory.
  For example, the `source/localizable/api/` directory contains the
  documentation for the *Api* project.
