# Authorization

To access privileged resources for our API 
<% if flavor == 'skroutz' %>
  or <%= link_to t('titles.easy', flavor: settings.site_name.titleize), '/easy' %>
<% end %>
you have to undergo the authorization procedure throughout the [OAuth2.0](http://oauth.net/2/)
protocol.

<%= partial 'partials/toc' %>

## Quick Start

Before you begin the authorization process make sure you have obtained a valid 
set of `client_id`, `client_secret`.

To get one <a href="mailto:api@<%= settings.domain %>">contact us</a>.

Now let's try something that requires authorization.

### Search using our API

Search does not require any resources to be granted by a user, so you have to
obtain an application token (see <%= link_to 'permissions', '/authorization/permissions' %>)

<%= render_code_from_file "authentication/#{flavor}/application_token" %>

Using the code above you'll get something like:

~~~ javascript
{
  "access_token": "a valid access token",
  "token_type":   "bearer",
  "expires_in":   2678399
}
~~~

You may then proceed performing the request using the following snippet:

<%= render_code_from_file "authentication/#{flavor}/example_search_request_header" %>

You will get the following response:

<%= render_recording :search_manufacturer_match %>

## About OAuth2.0

We leverage the [OAuth2.0](http://oauth.net/2/) protocol to enable selected external
applications get authorization for a User's private information from
<%= settings.site_name.titleize %> account without requesting their <%= settings.site_name.titleize %> credentials.

The benefit of using OAuth2.0 is that our users can feel secure as their credentials won't
have to be exposed to third parties in order to grant access to privileged user owned resources.
