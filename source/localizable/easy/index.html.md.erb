## Introduction

<%= settings.site_name.capitalize %> Easy helps users perform the checkout
process efficiently and faster.

By integrating <%= settings.site_name.capitalize %> Easy functionality in your
eshop you allow your visitors to use their existing
<%= settings.site_name.capitalize %> credentials, contact and billing details
when they checkout from your eshop.

The benefits for the visitors are multiple:

* No need to remember sign-in information for each and every eshop
* They don't have to fill-in contact and billing details every time
* The visitors don't have to verify their email address
* It makes the checkout faster and makes purchases from mobile devices easier
