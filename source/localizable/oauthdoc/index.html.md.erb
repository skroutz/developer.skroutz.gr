## About OAuth2

[OAuth2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) protocol allows 3rd party
applications to access personal data of a <%= settings.site_name %>
User without exposing any passwords.

The access to personal data is controlled and restricted to specific data types
(e.g. shipping address) and can be revoked from the User at any time. OAuth
offers the convenience to avoid email verifications and repetitive forms
completion.

A developer must register his application prior to proceed. Every OAuth 2.0
application is related with a *unique* `client_id` and a `client_secret`. The
`Client Secret` is **secret** and **must not** be shared with 3rd parties. You
should treat it like a password.

If you want to give it a try send us your request at <api@<%= settings.domain%>>
with the [required information](#api-partner-key) and we will answer you with your ready to use
credentials.

## Supported types

<%= settings.site_name %> supports a draft of
[OAuth 2.0 protocol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-16)
with [bearer tokens](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-bearer-06)
to access User personal data.

For now only the the flow for
[server-side web applications](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-16#section-4.1)
is supported.

## API partner key

In order to use the OAuth 2.0 API a **pair of keys**, `client_id` and
`client_secret`, is required. Send us your request at <api@<%= settings.domain %>>
including the following information:

* your **company name**
* your **website URL**
* the **redirect URI** to redirect users after the access authorization from <%= settings.site_name %>

## Best practices

Various researches conclude that major reasons for unfinished orders are the long
forms to complete and the mandatory registration for the checkout process.
"<%= settings.site_name.titleize %> Easy" services was created to solve that
problem. It helps your Users skip unnecessary checkout steps, thus, quickens and
simplifies the checkout process, resulting to more completed orders.

> Users do need to confirm their email or information. Email confirmation
process usually is a time consuming process, confuses users and leads to
unfinished orders.

> It is better not to require User Registration for the checkout process. If
it is an absolute need to register a User prior checkout, then you can register
him transparently using the provided email for a username and a random password.

## Terms of Use

* Personal data must not be shared with 3rd parties.
* Respect the <%= link_to 'terms of use', "http://#{settings.domain}/statics/terms" %>
  and the Privacy Policy of <%= settings.site_name.titleize %>.
