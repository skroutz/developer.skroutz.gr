# Examples <%= render_edit_link %>

The document demonstrates working example implementations to successfully track
your sales. Typically, an implementation consists of the following steps:

1. Prepare the Ecommerce data (order, items) on the server
2. Load the Analytics.js library
3. Report the Ecommerce data

<%= partial 'partials/toc' %>

## Prepare Ecommerce data

The first step is to prepare the Ecommerce data of a completed order.

Analytics reports data using the user's browser. Thus, some server-side logic
is required to dynamically provide the ecommerce data to the browser for
the Analytics client to report them.

##### Server-side Ecommerce data structure

Typically, the Ecommerce data on the server-side could have the following
structure:

<%= render_code_from_file 'analytics/examples/php/order_declaration' %>

##### JavaScript representation of Ecommerce data

Example server-side snippets to transform Ecommerce data on the server for into
JavaScript strings for Analytics could look like:

<%= render_code_from_file 'analytics/examples/php/order_preprocessing' %>

## Load Analytics.js

Next, add the Analytics.js tracking code to enable Analytics on your website.
You may add it just before closing either the `<head>` or `<body>` section.

<%= render_code_from_file "analytics/#{flavor}/js_snippet" %>

> ##### Note
> You **have to** replace the `'SA-XXXX-YYYY'` property with the actual *Shop Account ID*
you received from us.

## Report Ecommerce data

Finally, additional server-side logic is required to dynamically output the
transformed Ecommerce data. Before the closing tag of the `</body>` add the
following snippet, for the declaration of Analytics actions to happen:

<%= render_code_from_file 'analytics/examples/php/order_rendering' %>

> ##### Note
> Be sure to report any data **after** the Analytics.js declaration.
