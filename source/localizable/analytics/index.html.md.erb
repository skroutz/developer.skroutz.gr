# Analytics

Analytics is a project to measure how users interact with our partners websites.

##### <%= t('toc') %>

* toc
{:toc}

## Quick Start

To successfully report your sales insights you have to add the following
JavaScript snippet and declare actions, at least inside the page which informs
the user that the order is completed (eg. "Thank You" page).

You may add the snippet just before closing either the `<head>` or `<body>`
section.

###### Tracking Code JS Snippet

<%= render_code_from_file "analytics/#{flavor}/js_snippet" %>

> ##### Note
> You **have to** replace the `'SA-XXXX-Y'` property with the actual
*Shop Account ID* you received from us.

## How it works

> The source of the tracking script is hosted on
[GitHub](https://www.github.com/skroutz/analytics.js).

The tracking script, registers a new global function named `sa`, and then
asynchronously loads the `analytics.js` library onto the page.

The `sa` global function is the main way you interact with the Analytics library.
It accepts a sequence of parameters, that represent:

Category
: The API category

Command
: The Command of the API category you be executed

Data
: The Data to be reported by the Command

> ##### Note
> *Categories* and *Commands* are **case-sensitive**.
