# Ecommerce <%= render_edit_link %>

Ecommerce tracking allows you to measure the transactions and revenue generated
from your e-shop.

You can track two types of ecommerce data:

Order
: A completed order - transaction

Item
: An item of a completed order - transaction

<%= partial 'partials/toc' %>

## addOrder

The `addOrder` command creates an Ecommerce order object.

##### Data Parameters

Name       | Type   | Required | Description
---------- | ------ | -------- | -----------
`order_id` | String | Yes      | The Order ID that produced and stored at your e-shop to identify the transaction. This id is what links items to the orders to which they belong. (e.g. 123456)
`revenue`  | String | No       | The total revenue or grand total of the order (e.g. 120.99). This value must include shipping and tax costs.
