# Privacy Policy of CPC/CPS Mixed Billing Model

<%= partial 'partials/toc' %>

## What is the CPC/CPS Mixed Billing Model

The CPC/CPS Mixed Billing Model is one of the billing models of Skroutz associates,
according to which the charge is made depending on the category of products either per
click or based on commission on sale.
This model, in order to record purchases made on a merchant partner’s
website, after the user navigates to them via
Skroutz.gr, uses cookies, to calculate the relevant commission. The
CPC/CPS Mixed Billing Model works in parallel with, but also partially separately from,
the Skroutz Analytics functionality, the service of exporting statistics
on the performance of participating Skroutz stores.

## How it works

When a user switches from Skroutz to an associate store
participating in CPC/CPS Mixed Billing Model &mdash; and if a relevant purchase
is actually made &mdash; browsing data about the user's session in that store
are transmitted to Skroutz.

Cookies used to support the CPC/CPS Mixed Billing Model are disabled in
any case after 15 days, in accordance with commonly accepted sales acquisition practices.

It is clarified that these "Billing" cookies are activated without
the need for user consent, as they are absolutely necessary for the
calculation and settlement of the financial transaction. If the user does not give
his/her consent to "Performance" cookies in Skroutz.gr, only "Billing" cookies are activated,
while cookies for the operation of the Skroutz Analytics service are not.

If the user gives his/her consent to the "Performance" cookies in Skroutz.gr, when visiting
a store with CPC/CPS Mixed Billing Model, the Skroutz Analytics service and related cookies
are activated, a subset of which now becomes the charge/commission mechanism of the CPC/CPS
Mixed Billing Model. In this case, given the user's consent, Skroutz Analytics cookies serve
a dual purpose: export of statistics on the use of Skroutz services and calculation of
Skroutz charges/commissions.

## What data does it collect?

When the user visits an associate’s merchant  website that uses the CPC/CPS Mixed Billing Model,
their web browser sends certain information to Skroutz.

Specifically, the information recorded is:

- The transition from Skroutz to a merchant partner’s store
- Visits to pages of the merchant partner’s store
- The purchase of specific products and its details (order number, amount, products, payment method, etc.)
- Timestamp (browsing time)
- The IP address of the user
- Device-specific information (such as operating system version, app or web login, browser version)

The above is linked to an order ID, which does not directly identify the user for Skroutz. For other
categories of data collected by Skroutz when the Skroutz Analytics service is also enabled,
see more details [here](/analytics/privacy_policy/).

The information of a user that we receive from partners may be directly associated with that user's
Skroutz Account (Skroutz username), only after their own specific action (e.g., "Save my order to Skroutz").

Otherwise, data collected through the CPC/CPS Mixed Billing Model may be considered personal data by
applicable data protection laws, as it can identify a person (although they do not directly identify them).
For this reason, they are treated by us in each case and in their entirety as personal data and we apply
to them all appropriate technical and organizational security measures. Some of these measures can be found below.

## What data does it produce?

The data resulting from the CPC/CPS Mixed Billing Model are analyzed per store and per market.
If the user has also given his/her consent to the "Performance" cookies in Skroutz.gr, analyses
are also produced that capture sales statistics based on the store, the product, and each category.

## Data lifetime

The information associated with the Account of Skroutz is retained until deletion is requested.
Either through [their account](https://www.skroutz.gr/account) or by contacting the Data Protection Officer of Skroutz at <dpo@skroutz.gr> email.

The browsing data collected by Skroutz through cookies in view of the CPC/CPS Mixed Billing Model
is considered by Skroutz as contractual personal data, capable of proving the transaction and supporting
any legitimate claims of Skroutz. For this reason, this data will be kept for a maximum of 5 years.
This data will then be completely deleted or anonymized (i.e. it will no longer be considered personal data by law).

## How they are used

When a user visits websites or uses apps that use the CPC/CPS Mixed Billing Model,
we use the information we receive about purchases from those sites and apps to:

- Correctly calculate and invoice the associate for the commission from the
  use of our services.
- Detect and respond to fraud and other transaction security risks in
  order to protect users and partners.

## How we share data with third parties

We do not share personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals
outside our group.

As the collected and generated data of the CPS/CPS Mixed Billing Model is treated
by us as personal data of users, which is processed for common billing purposes
between the respective merchant associate and Skroutz, we are considered &mdash; based
on applicable law &mdash; Joint Data Controllers with each merchant associate using the
CPC/CPS Mixed Billing Model. Regarding our compliance with this, we undertake to
inform users and include a special mention in our contracts with our merchant partners.

## Lawfulness of data processing

The CPC/CPS Mixed Billing Model is a tool that works partially through cookies,
which aim to calculate and clear associate billing for commission from the use
of our services. The applicable legislation is in principle the e-Privacy Directive
and the Greek implementing Law 3471/2006, as in force, and the user's consent is not
required for the placement and subsequent reading of such cookies, strictly necessary
for the provision of Skroutz services to users.

In this context, we inform users in detail about the processing of their personal
data for transactional purposes, both in the [privacy policy](https://www.skroutz.gr/privacy)
and the [cookie policy](https://www.skroutz.gr/cookies) of Skroutz.gr.

Regarding the lawfulness of processing concerning the use of Skroutz Analytics,
please see more in our [Skroutz Analytics Privacy Policy](/analytics/privacy_policy/#section-8).

## Recommended compliance actions

According to the law, the user should in any case be informed about the use of cookies on his device.*
